# My Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! Here you can find a collection of my data science projects, each showcasing my skills and expertise in various areas.

## Projects

### [Project 1: Predicting Credit Card Defaults](https://github.com/yrovsen/default_credit_card)
**Description:** This project focuses on predicting credit card defaults using various classification models. The goal is to determine whether a client will default on their credit card payment based on a set of features. The project covers data preprocessing, model selection, optimization, and evaluation.
**Highlights:**
- Demonstrates effective preprocessing techniques and model selection.
- A few models have been trained and results given in terms of gini scores since dataset is imbalanced:\
