# My Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! Here you can find a collection of my data science projects, each showcasing my skills and expertise in various areas.

## Projects

### [Project 1: Predicting Credit Card Defaults](https://github.com/yrovsen/default_credit_card)
**Description:** This project focuses on predicting credit card defaults using various classification models. The goal is to determine whether a client will default on their credit card payment based on a set of features. The project covers data preprocessing, model selection, optimization, and evaluation.
**Highlights:**
- Demonstrates effective preprocessing techniques and model selection.
- A few models have been trained and results given in terms of gini scores since dataset is imbalanced:\

- Fine-tuned the CatBoost model for improved accuracy 82%.
- High Gini score obtained 54%.
- Evaluated model performance using ROC-AUC and precision-recall curves given below:

### [Project 2: Data Visualization](https://github.com/yourusername/project2)
**Description:** Created interactive visualizations to explore and analyze a dataset of customer transactions.
**Highlights:**
- Used Plotly for interactive visualizations.
- Analyzed customer purchasing patterns and trends.
- Presented findings in a Jupyter Notebook.

### [Project 3: Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/yourusername/project3)
**Description:** Developed a sentiment analysis model to classify customer reviews as positive or negative.
**Highlights:**
- Preprocessed text data using NLTK.
- Trained a logistic regression model with a TF-IDF vectorizer.
- Achieved an accuracy of 88% on the validation set.
